# What Is The Plan
* End to end machine learning/deep learning/artificial intelligence for companies

# Traditional ML/AI involves the following steps (oversimplified):
* Fetch and warehouse data **(Data Scrapers/Warehousers)**
* Analyse, visualize, interpret and find out fault/errors in Data **(Data Analysts)**
* Clean and impute data, find and fix data deviations **(Statisticians, Data Analysts)**
* Data transformation, compress and scaling **(Statisticians, Data Scientists)**
* Create, train, test, tune models **(Statisticians, Data Scientists)**
* Predict, visualize and deliver results **(Full Stack Web Developers)**

# How are they doing it?
* Data Warehouse on the cloud
* Data analysts get required, smaller version of the dataset to be analysed
* Clean data by writing scripts or using tools
* Transform using scripts or tools
* Model training on the cloud or GPUs(offline)
* Deliver model files to the developers
* Developers create an end point for predictions

# What are we doing now? (As a service)
* Automize [How are they doing it section](#how-are-they-doing-it) by writing scripts that run one by one to produce the final models (Directed Acyclic Graph)
* These are again manually served as an endpoint by me
* Every client gets a new system made

# What is the product we are trying to build?
* Automize [How are they doing it section](#how-are-they-doing-it) where the job of my customers would be absolutely nothing. They have to just sign up and the process starts from fetching data to giving out final results/predictions
* One product that will be used by all clients

# How will we get there?
* Currently need exposure to different kinds of data, different kinds of problems (which we are getting now) to understand and finetune the product we are trying to build

# What can we do (as a service)?
* Forecasting Time Series. **Eg: Sales forecast, IoT devices' failure detection (sensors), auto finantial trading etc.,**
* Recommendation Engines. **Eg: Similar to the ones you find on ecommerce sites, music apps and more**
* Classification/Regression. **Eg: Fraud detection, customer churn out, anamoly detection etc.,**
* Image recognition/classification/object detection. **Eg: Face recognition, detect specific objects and more**
* Chatbots, text analysis **(Using external NLP as a service tools)**

# What we can't do?
* Natural Langauge Processing (Without the help of any external NLP as a service tools)

# Raw tech/tools we can/am working with
* **Python** as a core programming language for most of the things (includes visualization, preprocessing etc)
* **Scala, Apache Spark** for **data transformation** and sometimes ML
* **Tensorflow** (Google's ML libarary), **PyTorch** (Facebook's ML Library) - for **production**, **serving** endpoints
* **Any databases** of any kind (usually picked based on the type of data coming in/going out)
* Almost everything related to: **AWS, Google Cloud, Azure**
* **Continuous integration, continuous deployment and delivery** using any tool for complete DevOps
* Software Engineering (Project Management) is being done through **MS Planner, Teams, Outlook, Flow** along with DevOps tools

# Raw tech/tools we can't work with
* **Cannot** build ML/AI at the accuracy of a mathematician/statistician with years of experience
* Security is very **minimal** (only of the APIs we build, rest of the things depend on the cloud provider)
* Not sure about **petabyte** scale data (we know how they are stored but havent worked with any)
* Not sure about **streaming/ingestion** data like Kafka, Message Queue etc

# Problems We are facing
* Work
  * Needs to be organised, modularised and planned better
  * All of it is done by me which is quite unstable and tiring. Need more people to ease my work
  * It takes time to implement the things [we have said above](#raw-techtools-i-canam-working-with)
  * Difficult to find people who understand at my level. If we do, we have to pay them a lot which we cant now
  * Burning money (literally) on cloud services, experiments. Will run out of it soon (;_;)
  * Idea, Product is vulnerable (can be replicated (no)? stolen(no)? we dont know the proper word for this)
* Resources
  * ML at production (sometimes at scale) is super expensive. Still have not found a solution to this as most clients are not willing to spend too much on this (at least the ones that we have contacted)
  * Most of it is drained by cloud providers and their services
* People
  * Will need people in the following categories:
    * **Full Stack Web Developers (React.js, Node.js):** UI, Database, Backend etc stuff
    * **Data Science/Math/Stats people:** Because Data (Python, Math, Stats)
    * **Data Engineering/Cloud:** Because everything is Cloud (Basically Cloud)
    * (Project managers, planners, communicators, maintainers, organizers in the future)
    * (Digital Marketing and mostly everything MBA)
* Exposure
  * More people involved in tech, connections
  * Investors, mentors for product developement

# Conclusion
* Have not started working on the product yet
* Learning from the services we are building (still haven't build a complete solution to showcase)
* Will finish building a few services that we can showcase by the end of August
* Need investment, which will trigger the process of hiring and product development
